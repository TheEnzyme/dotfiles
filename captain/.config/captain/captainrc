; A configuration file consists of sections, each led by a [section] header,
; followed by key/value entries separated by a specific string (= or : by default).
; By default, section names are case sensitive but keys are not. Leading and
; trailing whitespace is removed from keys and values. Values can be omitted,
; in which case the key/value delimiter mayacebook.com/ also be left out. Values can also
; span multiple lines, as long as they are indented deeper than the first line
; of the value. Depending on the parserâ€™s mode, blank lines may be treated
; as parts of multiline values or ignored.

; Configuration files may include comments, prefixed by specific characters
; (# and ; by default). Comments may appear on their own on an otherwise
; empty line, possibly indented.

; The [bar] section is reserved and used by the bar script. It contains the
; variables bound to the script and should not be mirrored to any file in the
; captain.d directory.

; Any manual script requires you to define 'manual = true'. All of the variables
; except reload are omited in the process. Other variables are to be placed manually
; by wrapping them in '<#' & '#>'.

; You can use dashes, these will be converted to underscores later. This also
; means you need to reference to them with underscores in the script.

; Events look the same, but are defined differently. You wrap them in '<@ & @>'
; A valid event would be '%{A1:<@event-name@>:}Hi!%{A}'.
